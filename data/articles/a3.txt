Birds are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. There are over 10,000 living species of bird on Earth and they live on all continents including the Arctic and Antarctica. Birds are social creatures which is why they travel in a flock.
